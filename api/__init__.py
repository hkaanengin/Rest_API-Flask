'''I decided to use Redis for Leaderboards. I thought that, making SQLite to sort thousands of user by their score point, would take too much time.
    Redis seemed working quite good on such sorting purposes. I have also bought a cloud with Redis server so that my app would work on it.
    15th line is to connect the cloud server I have bought.'''
